          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <p>
            I was born in Mountain View, CA, and raised back and forth between Santa Cruz, CA
            and Horseshoe Bend, ID. I was homeschooled for the majority of my life, and spent
            10 years dedicated to gymnastics. After high school, I started college at BSU,
            where I am currently getting a degree in GIMM (Games, Interactive Media, and
            Mobile Technology).
          </p>

            At some point in high school, I started messing around in GarageBand, and then in
            Logic Pro, and after several years of practice, I was able to write my own music.
            Despite having no formal training, I was able to pick it up quickly by composing
            by ear. Once I was well into getting my degree at BSU, I was able to write music
            for games made by several classmates of mine.
